About me:
======
I am a Ph.D. Candidate in [Water Resource Engineering](https://ce.gatech.edu/academics/groups/water) at Georgia Institute of Technology [(Georgia Tech)](https://www.gatech.edu/) , advised by [Prof. Jian Luo](https://ce.gatech.edu/directory/person/jian-luo). Before starting my Ph.D., I already earned two MS degrees of [Environmental Engineering](https://ce.gatech.edu/academics/groups/environmental) and [Computational Science & Engineering](https://cse.gatech.edu/) from Georgia Tech.

### What kind of person I am:

*	Passionate cross-disciplinary researcher in Data Science and Computer Engineering, dedicated to utilizing AI and machine learning to solve scientific problems and construct digital twins.
*	Over 5 years of experience in Python, proficient in writing clear and well-organized code, and deeply committed to continuous learning as the need arises.
*	Navigating the data science realm with using two key pillars: statistical analysis and guided background knowledge. Combining science and AI to make robust and accurate predictions from data.

Research interests:
======
My research is at the intersection of data science, machine learning, and traditional physics. Specifically, I employ physics-informed deep learning techniques to tackle complex groundwater inverse problems, particularly those related to hydraulic tomography. This involves leveraging both data-driven approaches and fundamental physical principles to train neural networks for parameter estimation in subsurface environments. 

My current research focuses on several key areas:

* __Physics-Informed Neural Networks__: Developing neural networks with combining physics-based knowledge to enhance predictive robustness.

* __Neural Operators and Surrogate Forward Models__: Exploring the use of neural operators to efficiently simulate complex physical processes.

* __Generative Modeling__: Implementing AI generative model for encoding complicated subsurface structures.

* __Bayesian Analysis and Random Fields__: Employing Bayesian analysis and random fields to model uncertainty and variability in geospatial data.

* __High-Performance Computing__: Utilizing high-performance computing resources to expedite data processing and model training.
