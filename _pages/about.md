About me:
======
I am a Ph.D. Candidate in [Water Resource Engineering](https://ce.gatech.edu/academics/groups/water) at [Georgia Institute of Technology](https://www.gatech.edu/) (Georgia Tech) , advised by [Prof. Jian Luo](https://ce.gatech.edu/directory/person/jian-luo). Before starting my Ph.D., I already earned two MS degrees of [Environmental Engineering](https://ce.gatech.edu/academics/groups/environmental) and [Computational Science & Engineering](https://cse.gatech.edu/) from Georgia Tech.

### What kind of person I am:

*	Passionate cross-disciplinary researcher in Data Science and Computer Engineering, dedicated to utilizing AI and machine learning to solve scientific problems and construct digital twins.
*	Over 5 years of experience in Python, proficient in writing clear and well-organized code, and deeply committed to continuous learning as the need arises.
*	Navigating the data science realm with using two key pillars: statistical analysis and guided background knowledge. Combining science and AI to make robust and accurate predictions from data.

### Don't hesitate to contact me:

*	Email: qguo48@gatech.edu
*	Office: Jesse W. Mason Building, Room 2230, 790 Atlantic Dr NW, Atlanta, GA 30332.

Research interests:
======
My research is at the intersection of data science, machine learning, and traditional physics. Specifically, I employ physics-informed deep learning and scientific AI techniques to tackle complex groundwater inverse problems, particularly those related to hydraulic tomography. This involves leveraging both data-driven approaches and fundamental physical principles to train neural networks for parameter estimation in subsurface environments. 

My current research focuses on several key areas:

* __Physics-Informed Neural Networks__: Combining physics-based knowledge to train neural networks with sparse data while enhancing generality and robustness.

* __Neural Operators__: Exploring the use of neural operators as surrogate forward models to efficiently solve high-dimensional PDE and simulate physical process. 

* __Generative Modeling__: Implementing AI generative models like MoCoGAN, StyleGAN, Normalizing Flow, etc to recognize and encode content and motion of images and videos, specifically for subsurface realizations.

* __Bayesian Analysis and High-Performance Computing__: Employing Bayesian analysis and high-performance computing to expedite numerical inverse optimization and uncertainty quantification.

* __Big data and Cloud Computing__: Developing Spark and Hadoop softwares for multi-source data assimilation and geospatial feature engineering
