About me:
======
I am a Postdoc in Los Alamos National Lab (LANL). Before coming to LANL, I studied in [Georgia Institute of Technology](https://www.gatech.edu/) (Georgia Tech) where I obtained a Ph.D of [Water Resource Engineering](https://ce.gatech.edu/academics/groups/water) (advised by [Prof. Jian Luo](https://ce.gatech.edu/directory/person/jian-luo)) and Masters of [Environmental Engineering](https://ce.gatech.edu/academics/groups/environmental) and [Computational Science & Engineering](https://cse.gatech.edu/).

### What kind of person I am:

*	Passionate cross-disciplinary researcher in Physics and Machine Learning, dedicated to utilizing AI and machine learning to solve scientific problems and construct digital twins.
*	Python Research and Development (R&D) since 2018, and deeply committed to continuous learning for efficient continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD).
*	Combining traditional domain knowledge and statistical analysis with modern big data and AI to make robust, scaling and trustworthy predictive models.

Research interests:
======
I am a versatile researcher specializing in physics simulations and AI-driven analysis, with expertise in numerical modeling, machine learning, and inference. My work focuses on leveraging advanced deep learning models to address challenges in spatio-temporal modeling and geophysical inference, aiming to bridge the gap between computational methods and real-world applications. My research spans several key areas:

<!-- This involves leveraging both data-driven approaches and fundamental physical principles to train neural networks for parameter estimation in subsurface environments.  -->

* __Scientific Machine Learning__: Educating machine learning with physical knowledge to solve PDEs efficiently: physics informed neural networks, neural operators, etc.

* __Bayesian Optimization & Inference__: Utilizing Bayesian and random fields to conduct dimensionality reduction and optimization for large-dimensional inverse problems.

* __Domain Generalization__: Creating AI generative models to encode multiple distributions, supporting uncertainty quantification with broader prior assumptions.

* __Digital Twin__: Developing Spark and Hadoop softwares for multi-source data assimilation and geospatial feature engineering Employing imaging and computer vision computer vision techniques to render invisible physical systems based on sensory data.
